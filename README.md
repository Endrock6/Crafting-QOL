Crafting QOL is a basic quality-of-life datapack that adds crafting recipes that make crafting a bit less annoying. As it certainly is at times.
Some mod versions of the datapack are available to download in the versions tab but are marked as beta because I have not tested them myself and can't guarantee their stability. The mod versions that have been fully tested are marked as releases.
